# BlinkWell Diagnostic

BlinkWell Diagnostic is an ocular triage engine that uses OpenAI's Responses API and Agents SDK to guide patients to the appropriate level of care (self‑care, virtual consult, or in‑person appointment). This repository contains the initial project scaffold with product requirements, API specifications, data models, SLO & COGS analysis, and go‑to‑market plan.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to deliver a low‑latency, compliant, and cost‑effective triage service that can be integrated into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and scheduling systems. We plan to use a web interface built with Next.js and TypeScript, multi‑agent orchestration powered by OpenAI's Responses API, and Terraform for cloud infrastructure.

This monorepo is organized into separate folders for the web application, agents, tools, infrastructure, simulation configs, continuous integration, and documentation.
