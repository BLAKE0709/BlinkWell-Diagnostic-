## Target Audiences
- Women aged 30‑60 experiencing dry eye symptoms.
- Teen and youth athletes needing quick triage for sports-related eye injuries.
- General telemedicine users seeking accessible eye care.

## Channels & Experiments

1. **Content marketing (blog/SEO)**

   - **Metric:** Increase sign-ups by 10% via landing pages attributed to blog traffic.

2. **Paid advertising (Google Ads)**
   - **Hypothesis:** Targeting keywords related to dry eye symptoms and telemedicine will acquire initial paying users at a reasonable cost.
   - **Metric:** Acquire the first 50 paying users with cost per lead (CPL) within budget.

3. **Partnerships with optometrist offices**
   - **Hypothesis:** A referral program with local optometry practices will reduce CAC and drive user trust.
   - **Metric:** 10 new users per partner practice in the first month.

4. **Athletic organizations & schools**
   - **Hypothesis:** Partnerships with high school and college athletic departments can drive adoption for sports-related eye injuries.
   - **Metric:** Onboard at least three athletic departments and see 30 users from these channels in the pilot period.

## Pricing Experiments

- Test **subscription** vs **tiered usage** models once traffic increases to understand lifetime value and retention.

## KPIs
